# GitHub Skills

These are free, open-source, self-paced learning exercises conducted directly within the GitHub platform using an "issue belt based" approach.

- Issue-based and, self-paced, all learning about GitHub within GitHub.
- All open source, so it's free and people can take part in that."

## Features
- They allow users to learn various GitHub features (e.g., Copilot, security, repo management) typically in under 60 minutes.
- The learning process is interactive, using GitHub Issues to provide steps and activities.
  - A background action called "Mona" provides feedback on completion and progress.

## How does it work?

You simply click `Go to Exercise` and it sets up a copy of the repository template in your GitHub handle or exercise of your choosing.
After some time (via Mona actions running in the background) it will update you to `Go to Exercise` when you click it you are redirected to an open issue to
walk you through running Mona actions, we call it Mona that will come in and then update to tell you if you've passed it or if you have missed something, and will provide tips to help you troubleshoot to make changes and try again. Mona will continue to provide feedback along the way for each exercise step in the issue until you complete the exercise.
